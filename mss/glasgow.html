<h3>MS Murray 416</h3>

<p class="p1">A large bound notebook, used by Locke from 1691-1700. 
Most of the notes are not in Locke&rsquo;s hand, although writing in his hand occurs on many pages, 
typically the headings and the first line of the entry. 
Most of the entries are dated. 
The book seems to have been intended by Locke as a medical commonplace book, 
but it contains a variety of medicinal and culinary receipts as well as other domestic notes by members of the Masham family, 
many of them dating after Locke&rsquo;s death. 
The book seems to have remained in use at Oates after the bulk of Locke&rsquo;s manuscripts had been delivered 
(according to the provisions of Locke&rsquo;s will) to his cousin Peter King.</p>

<p class="p2">According to notes on the front pastedown, the notebook remained in the possession of the Masham family, 
being given to one of his nieces by Francis Cudworth Masham in 1727. 
It was acquired by the Victorian book collector Alexander Burrell, along with several books from Locke&rsquo;s library; 
all this material was subsequently purchased by Alexander Murray and were given by him to Glasgow University Library in 1928.</p>

<p class="p2">4<sup>o</sup>. 233 &#0215; 180 mm. <i>6</i>, 553, <i>6</i> pages. 
Pages 1-140 are numbered in ink on both recto and verso; the numbering continues in pencil to page 153, 
and on recto pages only through page 553. 
Written entries occupy pages 1-153 and a few fragments have been tipped in towards the end of the written text. 
A left margin in pencil is drawn on all pages containing written text through page 171; the remainder of the book is completely blank.
The volume was rebound in 1983, but the endpapers and pastedowns have been preserved.</p>
