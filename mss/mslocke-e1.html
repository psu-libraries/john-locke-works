<h2>MS. Locke e. 1</h2>


<p class="p1">A guardbook in which are mounted gatherings containing drafts for planned additions 
to the fourth edition of the <i>Essay</i>  (1700). 
For the most part, the text is written in Locke&#0146;s hand; pp. 210-216 in the hand of William Shaw. 
The text is written on the left-hand (verso) pages, with additions and corrections on the right-hand (recto) pages.</p>

<p class="p2">8<sup>o</sup>. <!--size--> &pi;<sup>3</sup> A-N <i>O-R</i><sup>8</sup>.   
<i>vi</i>, 261, <i>262-270</i> pages (with many errors). 
The caption &#0147;Understanding&#0148; and signature appears on final verso of signed gatherings; 
only the signature appears on the first recto. 
The volume was bound after its acquisition by the Bodleian; 
however, there are signs of earlier stitching that indicates all the gatherings had once been bound together; 
there are also pinholes indicating that the leaves of each gathering had been pinned together.</p>

<p class="p2">For the most part, the drafts occupy the verso of each leaf, 
leaving the rectos for additions and corrections.</p>

Contents
[6] Page i, from top to foot: the last part of an index to Of the Conduct of the Understanding (the first part of this index was probably on a previous page that has been lost, [5], but p. i must already have been the first page of what is now called ‘MS e.1’ about as long as p. 270 has been its last page, since both pages are discoloured in a similar degree); instructions by Locke: ‘Mem: That these following discourses are to be writ out under their several heads into distinct Chapters, and then to be numberd and ranged according to their natural order’, followed by the stamp of the Bodleian Library; and finally ‘MS Locke e.1’ in the hand of the Bodleian librarian. 
Page iv: the Ciceronian motto: ‘Quid tam temerarium tamque indignum sapientis gravitate atque constantiâ, quam aut falsum sentire, aut quod non satis explorate perceptum sit et cognitum sine ullâ dubitatione defendere? Cic: de Nat: deorum l. 1’ (see ill. 1). 
Page 1 contains several fragments: 
  (1) a list of some subjects (most of them deleted) that Locke was to address in the Conduct; 
  (2) some loose remarks, anticipating the text of the Conduct (see again ill. 1); 
  (3) draft for Essay, IV.xix.10, ‘Of Enthusiasm’ (deleted). 
Pages 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9: draft for Essay, IV.xix.1-4, ‘Of Enthusiasm’ (deleted); the chapter on enthusiasm was included in the Fourth Edition, and also in the Fifth Edition and subsequent editions. 
Pages 6, 8, 9, 10, 11: draft for Essay, IV.iii.6, ‘Of the Extant of Humane Knowledge’ (deleted); also included in the Fourth Edition. 
Pages 10-30: Draft for Essay, IV.xix.5-16, ‘Of Enthusiasm’ (deleted); included in the Fourth Edition as well. 
Pages 30-31: a list of scriptural passages. 
Pages 32-56: a piece on ‘Association’ (deleted); 
  pages 32-54 were used for Essay, II.xxiii, ‘Of the Association of Ideas’ (up to ‘...that follow’, §18, p. 401, line 9 in Nidditch’s 
  edition), while the content of pp. 52-56 reappears (but probably not as a direct copy), in par. 78-79 of the Conduct, on pp. 210-216 
  in the same MS (however, this later version is probably not copied directly from the first version; see [9]). 
Pages 56-62: a passage on ‘Reasoning’ (belonging to the Conduct and continued on pp. 248-261 of the same MS). 
On p. 62 starts ‘B: IV C: XX Of the Conduct of the understanding’ (see ill. 2). 
The rest of the MS, up to and including p. 261, is covered by the text of the Conduct, 
  with the exception of p. 182, which gives an addition to Essay, IV.xii.3 
  and p. 184, which has an addition to Essay, III.vi.26 (both passages deleted); 
  both passages were included in the Fourth Edition of the Essay. 
Page 81 contains a short list (deleted), similar to the one on p.1, of subjects that Locke was to address in the Conduct; 
and p. 270 ends with an entry in the Bodleian librarian’s hand: ‘vi+270 pages really 272 for 154, 155 are double’ and with again the stamp of the Bodleian Library. 
Deletion of the Essay passages does not imply their rejection but their transcription elsewhere.

(2) Entries stating the content of one or more paragraphs (headwords), placed at the start of a new paragraph. From p. 208 onwards, headwords started in the margin are continued into the space reserved for the main text, while no more keywords are given. (3) Entries high-lighting a specific topic within a paragraph (keywords) and whose place can be anywhere in the margin alongside the text. It is not always possible to distinguish with certainty between headwords and keywords (headwords/keywords appear in the Conduct only and ar listed in Table 2, at the end of this chapter). (4) Entries consisting of numbers that appear after some headwords/keywords: p. 56: Reasoning 1; p. 60: partial views 3; p. 62: Introduction 4 (‘4’ superimposed on ‘61’); p. 62: Parts 6; p. 64: Practise 9; p.68: Habits 11; p. 78: Suffisance 19. (5) Entries consisting of a vertical line in the margin: pp. 56-64, 114-116 and 248-260; the line signals the transcription of the text from these pages to another document (see [EMPTY REF]).
