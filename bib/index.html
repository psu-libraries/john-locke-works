<p class="pflush"><span class="drop-cap"><b>T</b></span>he <span class="title">John Locke Bibliography</span> 
is intended as a comprehensive listing of publications by or about John Locke. 
I began to compile the bibliography in 1975; by the end of 2005, it contained well over 9000 entries.  
The first result of this project was a checklist of editions and translations of Locke&#0146;s works, 
published in 1985 (now updated as Part One of this bibliography).  
In 1994, I began creating the <i>John Locke Bibliography</i> on the World Wide Web, 
beginning with recent publications and gradually adding the rest of the material that I have collected since 1975. 
This process was completed in December 2005; the <i>John Locke Bibliography</i> is at last complete.</p>

<p class="pindent">A major component of the bibliography is the recording of recently-published titles, 
as a complement to the lists published by Roland Hall in the annual <a href="#ls"><b><i>Locke Studies</i></b></a>.  
I will continue to add any new items that I discover or of which I am informed.  The entries will be cumulated.  
A chronological list of items added to the bibliography over the past 12 months can be found in the 
<a href="new.html">&#0147;Recent additions to the bibliography.&#0148;</a></p>

<p class="pindent">I welcome comments on this bibliography, as well as suggestions for inclusion.  
<!--The latter should also be sent to Roland Hall for inclusion in <i>Locke Studies.</i>--></p>

<p class="heading">Organization of the Bibliography</p>

<p class="pindent">This bibliography is organized into two parts.  
Part One, &#0147;Works by John Locke,&#0148; is an updated version of my <a href="ch1.html#06472">
<i>The Works of John Locke</i></a>, which was published by Greenwood Press in 1985.  
This part is now a complete checklist of editions and translations (although some entries need to be corrected 
and some publications since 1985 have yet to be added).  
Researchers seeking more detailed information on editions and translations published before 1800, 
should consult Jean S. Yolton&#0146;s <a href="ch1.html#07815"><i>John Locke : a descriptive bibliography</i></a> 
(Thoemmes Press, 1998).</p>

<p class="pindent">Part Two,  &#0147;Writings about Locke,&#0148; is divided into twelve topical chapters.  
Arrangement in each chapter is by date of publication and then by author&#0146;s name.  
In two chapters (3, &#0147;Philosophy,&#0148; and 7, &#0147;Politics and Government&#0147;), 
there are separate pages for each year.  
There are three indexes:  &#0147;Name/Title&#0148; and &#0147;Subject&#0148; cover the entire bibliography; 
the &#0147;Language Index,&#0148; only translations of Locke&#0146;s works.  
I have provided a variety of hypertext links between related entries 
and between entries in the bibliography and the index.  
There are also hypertext navigational aids at the top and bottom of each &#0147;page.&#0148;</p>

<p class="heading">Design Notes</p>

<p class="pindent">The <i>John Locke Bibliography</i> is encoded using HTML version 4.0.  
It makes extensive use of Cascading Style Sheets version 1 (CSS).  It therefore requires the use of version 4.0 
(or later) of either Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator.  (It was designed using Navigator, 
but tested with both browsers.)  
Displays in earlier versions of these browsers will be unpredictable and probably unsatisfactory.  
<!--The rollover navigation buttons at the bottom of each page (as well as a few text elements) 
require use of JavaScript.--></p>

<p class="pindent">Typeface and type size have been specified for virtually every bit of text on the site.  
The basic typeface is Garamond, which gives the text an &#0147;old style&#0148; look.  
<!--The graphic headings use an Adobe&reg; font called Caslon Antique, a distressed-type version of the classic early-18th-century typeface.  The same font is specified for other section headers (such as years); if you don&#0146;t have this font installed, the header will display in Garamond or Times Roman.-->  
Font sizes are <i>always</i> specified as percentages of the browser default; 
if the text appears too large or too small, you can adjust this by changing your browser&#0146;s default text size.</p>

<p class="pindent">The master graphic used throughout this site is my own rendering of Locke&#0146;s &#0147;paraph&#0148; &#0151; 
the cryptic design that Locke inscribed in some of the books in his library.  
See <a href="ch11.html#03170"><i>The library of John Locke</i></a> / by John Harrison and Peter Laslett. 
&#0150; 2nd ed. &#0150; Oxford : Clarendon Press, 1971. &#0150; p. 41-42.</p>

<!--<p class="pindent">The site was created using various versions of the HotDog&reg; HTML editing program from Sausage Software.  
The Javascript rollover navigation buttons were created using Dreamweaver&reg; from Macromedia Software, 
as was the initial creation of the Cascading Style Sheet.  
Graphics were created with Paint Shop Pro&reg;.</p>-->

<!--
<p class="heading">Future Plans</p>

<p class="pindent">The present site is part of a much larger project.  
I began compiling a bibliography of works by and about John Locke around 1975.  
By the end of the year 2003, this bibliography contained almost 9000 items.  
The first public result of this project was the checklist of editions and translations of Locke&#0146;s works, published in 1985 (now updated as Part One of this bibliography).  
In 1994, I began creating the <i>John Locke Bibliography</i> on the World Wide Web, 
containing recently-published titles; all subsequent additions to the bibliography have been included 
on the Web site.</p>

<p class="pindent">I am now in the process of adding older items, thus changing the character of the site. 
Although the main goal remains the listing of recent publications, major sections now include significant listings of older material. 
Part One, Works by Locke, is now virtually complete 
(only the Appendix of Doubtful Attributions remains to be added).
The following chapters are also complete: 
Chapter 1, Bibliography; Chapter 6, Toleration; Chapter 8, Political Economy; Chapter 9, Science and Medicine; 
and Chapter 11, Books and Reading.
Chapter 7, Politics and Government, is complete through 1900.
Chapters 2, Biography and General Works; Chapter 3, Philosophy; and Chapter 5, Religion, now include 
significant sections on 17th- and 18th-century items. 
Finally, I have been adding items requested or suggested by readers of the bibliography. 
I am grateful for these suggestions.</div>
<div class="pindent">I am considering a number of other enhancements.  
I plan to add a set of HTML forms for authors (and others) to submit suggestions for titles to be added.  
I am also exploring the possibility of adding a search engine 
to supplement the access provided through the indexes.</p>

is a calendar of datable events in the life, and material in the papers, of John Locke.</p>

<p class="pindent">The first content being added to the <i>John Locke Chronology</i> consists of information about Locke&rsquo;s whereabouts. 
Using his Journals and Correspondence, it is possible to determine where Locke was on any given day for a great part of his life. 
Detailed evidence begins in November 1675, when Locke began his Journal as he embarked on a trip to France. 
From that point until the end of his life, Locke kept a Journal. 
Although the amount of detail recorded diminishes, particularly after his return to England from Holland in 1689, it is still possible to track most of his movements. 
Locke&rsquo;s correspondence fills in some of the gaps, and also provides some evidence of his movements before 1675.</p>

<p class="pindent">The site consists of two main sections:

These lists are linked to the corresponding items in the <i>John Locke Bibliography.</i> 
Distinctive linking colors are used: 
links to the <i>John Locke Bibliography</i> are in <font color="#663300">brown</font>;

The journal is unique in being the only one in the world devoted entirely to Locke scholarship.</p>

<p class="pindent">The journal publishes articles and research notes on all aspects of Locke&rsquo;s life and work,

Submissions may be made in English, French, German, or Italian.  
All articles are blind peer-reviewed.</p>

The journal was founded and edited for 43 years by Roland Hall; 
since 2013, <i>Locke Studies</i> has been edited by Timothy <a href="http://www.york.ac.uk/politics/our-staff/tim-stanton/"><b>Stanton</b></a>. 
During 2018-2019, Benjamin <b>Hill</b> will serve as interim editor, and a new editor will be appointed by the new Editorial Board to begin in 2020
