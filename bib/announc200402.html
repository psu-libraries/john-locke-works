<h2>Announcing . . .</h2>
<p>
<div class="p1">In February 2004, the <font color="#663300"><b><i>John Locke Bibliography</i></b></font> 
passed two significant milestones.</div>

<div class="p1">First, Part One, Works by Locke, is not virtually complete. 
Some of the entries need to be corrected, and there are a number of items published since 1985 
that need to be added. 
However, there is now a basic checklist of all editions and translations of Locke&#0146;s works.</div>

<div class="p1">Second, I am pleased to announce the launching of a companion site, devoted to 
<font color="#006600"><b><i>John Locke Manuscripts.</i></b></font> 
This site is designed to serve two functions: 
(a) to serve as a listing of transcriptions of Locke manuscripts, linked to the items in the bibliography 
in which they appear; and 
(b) to serve as a guide to the location and content of Locke manuscripts.  
For more information, see the new section in the Preface.
</div>

<div class="p1">In addition to these major milestones, the content of Part Two of the bibliography continues to expand. In addition to the complete version of Chapter 1, Bibliography, the following chapters are also complete:
Chapter 6, Toleration; Chapter 8, Political Economy; Chapter 9, Science and Medicine; and Chapter 11, Books and Reading. Chapter 7, Politics and Government, is complete through 1900, and some early items have been added 
to Chapter 2, Biography and General Works; Chapter 3, Philosophy; and Chapter 5, Religion.
While there have thus been significant additions of older materials, the main goal of the site 
remains the comprehensive listing of recent publications.</div>

<div class="p1">I continue to receive a suggestions for additions to the bibliography.  
I greatly appreciate these suggestions.</div>

<div class="p1">My thanks again to everybody who has found this site useful.</div>
