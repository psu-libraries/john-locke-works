<i>Essay concerning human understanding</i> (1689)

<p class="int">John Locke is known today primarily as the author of <i>An essay concerning human understanding.</i>  This would no doubt have pleased him.  It was the work in which he invested the most effort and on which he staked his reputation.  While he jealously guarded the secret of his authorship of other works, he acknowledged the <i>Essay</i> from the outset.  His signature was appended to the dedication in the first edition; from the second edition (1694), his name appeared on the title page, opposite his engraved portrait.</div>

<p class="int1">Locke had begun work on the Essay in 1671.  In the &#0147;Epistle to the Reader,&#0148; 
he related that &#0147;five or six Friends meeting at my Chamber, and discoursing on a Subject very remote from this, found themselves quickly at a stand, by the Difficulties that rose on every side.  After we had a while puzzled out selves, without coming any nearer a Resolution of those Doubts which perplexed us, it came into my Thoughts, that we took a wrong course; and that, before we set our selves upon Enquiries of that Nature, it was necessary to examine our own Abilities, and see, what Objects our Understandings were, or were not fitted to deal with.  This I proposed to the Company, who all readily assented; and thereupon it was agreed, that this should be out first Enquiry.  Some hasty and undigested Thoughts, on a Subject I had never before considered, which I set down against our next Meeting, gave the first entrance into this Discourse, which having been thus begun by Chance, was continued by Intreaty; written by incoherent parcels; and, after long intervals of neglect, resum&#0146;d again, as my Humour or Occasions permitted; and at last, in a retirement, where an Attendance on my Health gave me leisure, it was brought into that order, thou now seest it.&#0148;
</div>

<p class="int1">Some of the &#047;incoherent parcels&#0148; still survive, allowing us to trace the development of the work.  
(These drafts are discussed <!--on p. 151--> below.)  After completing two initial drafts dated 1671, Locke took up the manuscript again in 1683/84 in Holland and a complete draft was finished in 1686.  Final revisions and the preparation of the abstract published by Le Clerc 
(<a href="ch0a.html#epitome">Locke #38-40</a>) were completed before Locke returned to England in February 1689.  Shortly thereafter, 
he signed an agreement with Thomas Bassett to publish the book, which duly appeared in December 1689 
(although the publisher gave the date &#0147;1690&#0148; on the title page).</div>

<p class="int1">The <i>Essay</i> consists of four books.  In Book I, Locke establishes that our ideas are not innate.  In Book II, he goes on to show that ideas are the result of experience, of sensation and the 
mind&#0146;s reflection upon its experiences.  In Book III, he describes how ideas and propositions are expressed in words and language.  Finally, in Book IV, he discusses knowledge, the degrees of knowledge and opinion, and the limits of human understanding.  His conclusion is that, while there can be no certain knowledge of matters of fact involving substance, the nature of moral ideas makes it possible to have certain knowledge of the laws of morality.</div>

<p class="int1">Locke continued to work on the <i>Essay</i> after 1690.  Four editions were published during his lifetime, and he left material for a revised fifth edition (published in 1706).  To these editions, 
he added important discussions on liberty and determinism, identity, perception, enthusiasm and the association of ideas.  In the late 1690&#0146;s he began a new final chapter on the &#0147;conduct of the understanding.&#0148;  This was never incorporated into the <i>Essay</i>, but was published separately by his literary executors in 1706<!-- (see p.117-118 below)-->.  The logical next step, having argued that certain knowledge of the laws of morality is attainable, would have been a treatise on ethics.  Although urged by friends to write such a treatise, Locke never produced more than a few tentative notes.</div>

<div id="abr">
<h4 class="l2">
Abridgments of the <i>Essay</i></h4></div>

<p class="int">Although the <i>Essay</i> was greeted with both praise and blame, the sincerest compliments which its author received were from those who felt the work would be of service in the study of philosophy in the universities.  As early as 1692, William Molyneux informed Locke that his friend Dr. Ashe was having his students at Trinity College, Dublin, read an abridged version.  In 1695, an Oxford fellow, John Wynne, wrote Locke his suggestion for publishing an abridgment.  Locke agreed, approved Wynne&#0146;s efforts and the abridgment was published by the Churchills in March 1696.  It was to have a wide influence.  Besides appearing in over a dozen editions during the eighteenth century, it was translated into French (Locke #365) and Italian (Locke #393) &#0150; both frequently reprinted &#0150; and even into Greek (Locke #387).</div>

<p class="int1">Another influential abridgment, this one directed at students of the law, was published in 1709 by Lord Chief Baron Gilbert.  Throughout the nineteenth century, abridged versions designed as university textbooks continued to appear.  This tradition has continued into the present century, the most notable examples being the versions prepared by Pringle-Pattison in 1924 (Locke #308) and by Woozley in 1964 
(Locke #314).</div>
