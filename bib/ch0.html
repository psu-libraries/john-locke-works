INTRODUCTION
<img src="../images/paraph3.gif" width=26 height=25 border=0 align=bottom hspace=15 />
</h2>

<p class="int">
<span class="drop-cap">J</span><span class="sm"><b>ohn Locke</b></span> was born in 1632.  
He published three of his most significant works in 1689, 
in the midst of a period which Paul Hazard has called the &#0147;crisis of European 
consciousness.&#0148;<a href="#n1"><sup>1</sup></a>  
Locke&#0146;s works, written in English and popularized in French reviews and translations, 
contributed to a climate of scepticism, enthusiastic scientific observation and experimentation, 
and religious and political liberty.  He was one of the thinkers whose ideas laid the foundations 
for the Enlightenment, and thus for &#0147;modern&#0148; philosophy and science.  
His works are still studied today by scholars interested in the history and perennial problems 
of a wide range of disciplines.</p>

<p class="int1">Locke is a major figure in the history of philosophy<a href="#n2"><sup>2</sup></a> 
as the author of a &#0147;classic&#0148; work (<i>An essay concerning human understanding</i>) which pointed philosophers in directions they are still exploring.  In 1976, J. L. Mackie published a discussion of some major topics in current philosophy which owe significant formulations to Locke.<a href="#n3"><sup>3</sup></a>   
His list includes such topics as primary and secondary qualities and the nature of substance, perception, abstraction, 
and personal identity.  Locke was also one of the first philosophers 
to note the importance of language in philosophical discourse.</p>

<p class="int1">Locke&#0146;s contributions to political theory at one time seemed equally significant.  
His <i>Two treatises of government</i> (1689) was considered the model defense of the Glorious Revolution 
and an important influence on the American revolutionaries.  Historians of political thought are now re-evaluating his influence 
(see <a href="ch0d.html#criticisms">&#0147;Early notices of the <i>Two Treatises</i>&#0148;</a>) 
and stressing the uniqueness of his ideas.  At the same time, his influence on political philosophy continues.  
Two significant recent works &#0151; John Rawls&#0146; <i>A theory of justice</i> (1971) and 
Robert Nozick&#0146;s <i>Anarchy, state and utopia</i> (1974) &#0151; base major arguments on Locke&#0146;s ideas 
of the social contract, the state of nature, and property rights.  
In addition, his ideas on toleration are studied today for their central role in his own thought, 
as well as for their contribution to the battle against intolerance, censorship and the repression of human rights &#0151; 
a battle where final victory seems always elusive.</p>

<p class="int1">Locke&#0146;s thoughts on education have maintained their popularity and influence 
since they were first published in 1693.  He wrote during an era when children were coming to be seen as children, as human beings in a family and social setting who had not yet developed their bodies and minds.  
Historians and theorists of education trace the origin of modern ideas of developmental psychology to Locke.</p>

<p class="int1">In recent decades, we have been reminded that Locke considered himself a physician by profession 
and that he studied with some of the most advanced scientific and medical minds of his day 
(in particular, Boyle, Sydenham, and Newton).<a href="#n4"><sup>4</sup></a>  Likewise, scholars have described Locke&#0146;s participation in the administration under William III and the influence of his views on economic and colonial policy.  
Ironically, the contributions which have attracted the least attention from recent scholars are his theological and Biblical studies, which Locke clearly saw as the culmination of his life&#0146;s work.</p>

<p class="int1">Locke thus made significant contributions in a variety of disciplines: 
philosophy, political science, education, religion, economics, science and medicine.  
His work in all these areas is the subject of scholarly research by a growing band of scholars from all nations. 
These scholars have access to a wealth of resources, including a rich collection of Locke&#0146;s manuscripts 
(drafts of his works, diaries, notebooks, correspondence, etc.) 
and many of the books from his library.<a href="#n5"><sup>5</sup></a>  
His major works have been widely translated, and 
a definitive edition of his works is currently being published by the Clarendon Press.  
There is even an annual journal, <i>Locke Studies</i>, devoted to Locke studies.</p>

<p class="int1">There is one major item absent from this list of resources.  
There is no single, comprehensive bibliography of Locke's works and of critical writings about Locke.  
The last such bibliography was compiled by H. O. Christophersen in 1930; 
it is now out-of-date, incomplete, uneven in its standards of description, and lacks an adequate index.  
While there have been various attempts to bring it up-to-date, it has yet to be completely superseded.</p>

<p class="int1">The present volume is part of such a comprehensive bibliographical resource.  
It covers the most pressing need: for a listing of Locke&#0146;s works, the editions and translations 
which have appeared, and the controversial context in which they were written.<a href="#n6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p class="int"><b>SCOPE:</b> The following listing encompasses all editions and translations of Locke&#0146;s works, 
including abridgments and selections in anthologies, from the first editions to the present (roughly April 1985), 
as well as the forthcoming Clarendon edition (see <a href="ch0m.html#05860">Locke #861</a>).  
In addition, Locke&#0146;s works are set in their original controversial context: entries are included for works Locke wrote about, 
and sections of entries are given for the controversies which his works provoked 
during and immediately following his lifetime.<a href="#n7"><sup>7</sup></a>  
The listing of Locke&#0146;s works includes not only those items of which he was the author, but also several works which he edited or translated and two works in which his role is uncertain.  Finally, there is an appendix of incorrect or doubtful attributions: works that have been ascribed to Locke but in which it is reasonably certain that he had no part.</p>

<p class="int1">The entries in the checklist contain extensive bibliographical annotations: 
relationships to other works, citations of secondary literature relating to bibliographic issues such as dating, publishing history, corrections to the text, etc.</p>

<p class="int"><b>ARRANGEMENT:</b> Locke&#0146;s works are arranged chronologically 
by date of first publication.<a href="#n8"><sup>8</sup></a>  Under each work, complete texts in the original language appear first, 
followed by abridged versions, selections and translations (arranged by language, with full texts preceding abridgments and selections).  Finally, I have included sections of early notices, attacks, and defenses of Locke&#0146;s works.  In these, the item numbers of works not by Locke appear in brackets and the entries begin with the author&#0146;s name.  
Near the end of the list, corresponding to the date of Locke&#0146;s death in 1704, 
there is a brief section of early biographical sketches, followed by the works first published after Locke&#0146;s death.  
This includes editions of his correspondence and collected editions of his works.  Works published from his manuscripts appear at the end, according to the date of first publication, not the date of composition.  
An appendix, described above, lists works incorrectly attributed to Locke.</p>

<p class="int1">In most cases, each edition is represented by a separate entry, 
while variant issues or states within an edition are noted under the single descriptive entry.  
However, by the nineteenth century, the practices of machine printing may have deprived this distinction 
of much of its meaning.  For this reason &#0151; and to avoid extensive repetition &#0151; 
I have in some cases combined entries for basically similar versions, 
particularly of <i>An essay concerning human understanding</i> and <i>Of the conduct of the understanding.</i>  
The variable information is listed in the notes.</p>

<p class="int"><b>DESCRIPTIVE STANDARDS:</b> One of the difficulties with the existing bibliographic tools dealing with Locke is their inadequate and inconsistent standards of description.  
Ideally, what is needed is a formal descriptive bibliography, compiled by examination of multiple surviving copies of each edition, transcription of the bibliographic information in precise detail, and identification 
of each variant issue or state of the text.  Such a formal bibliography has been prepared by Jean S. Yolton. 
The present work offers a checklist of editions with notes on such variants as I have discovered.  
It is based, whenever possible, upon personal examination of at least one copy of each edition.  
Where I have been unable to see the item, an asterisk appears before the item number and the source 
of the information is identified.  In other cases, the information given has been transcribed directly 
from the item according to one of two descriptive standards:</p>

<ol>
<li><span class="bi">To 1800:</span>  For books published in 1800 or earlier, the descriptions follow the rules 
devised for the <i>Eighteenth-century short-title catalogue.</i><a href="#n9"><sup>9</sup></a>  
The wording and punctuation of the title page is transcribed, omitting only quotations, authors' affiliations, and publishers&#0146; addresses.  The order of elements in a typical entry is:</li>

<p class="int4">Title.  Subtitle.  Author&#0146;s name [supplied in brackets if known but not appearing 
on the title page].  Edition statement.  Place of publication, names of publishers, 
and date of publication.  Paging and format.</p>

<p class="int" style="font-size: 100%; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px;">
The number of pages is recorded (accounting for all leaves with letterpress on either side).  
The bibliographic format (2<sup>o</sup> for folio, 4<sup>o</sup>. for quarto, 8<sup>o</sup>. for octavo, etc.) 
has been determined from the item itself whenever possible; catalogs are often misleading in their identification of format.</p>

<li><span class="bi">Since 1800:</span>  For books published after 1800, the descriptions follow the International Standard Bibliographic Description,<a href="#n10"><sup>10</sup></a> 
an internationally-devised and maintained specification of the elements 
which make up a standard description, the prescribed order in which those elements are to be transcribed 
and the distinctive marks of punctuation which identify each element.  
The following represents a typical entry:</li>

<p class="int4">Title or short title : subtitle and remainder of title information / 
first statement of responsibility ; subsequent statement of responsibility. &#0150; 
Edition statement. &#0150; Place of publication ; second place of publication : name of publisher : 
name of second publisher, date of publication. &#0150; Number of volumes or pages. &#0150; 
(Series statement, following the same format as title statements). &#0150; Notes.</p>

<p class="int" style="font-size: 100%; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px;">
In the case where the title page gives information in more than one language, 
the title statement gives information in each language, separated by &#0147; = &#0148;.  
Other elements, such as edition and imprint statements, are given in the first language only.</p>

<p class="int" style="font-size: 100%; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; text-indent: 1.25em;">
To date, the ISBDs do not cover items published as an integral part of another item, 
such as periodical articles or chapters in a book.  
There is, however, a draft ISBD for such &#0147;component parts,&#0148; and the principle is clear.  
The description includes two levels: for the specific part described and for the item which contains it. 
The relevant elements are transcribed for each level, separated by &#0147; // IN:&#0148; and the description 
of the containing item includes as a final note the location (volume, date and/or pages) of the specific item described within the containing item.  <a href="#n2">Note 2</a> and <a href="#n4">note 4</a> are examples 
of such descriptions.</p>
</ol>

<p class="int" style="padding-top: 10pt;"><b>ANNOTATIONS:</b> 
Bibliographic notes of various types have been included:</div>

<ol>
<li>&#0147;Issued with&#0148; notes are given for items with separate title pages but routinely found 
with other works.  Norris&#0146;s <i>Cursory reflections</i> [Locke #[435]), for example, 
was always attached to one or the other of Norris&#0146;s other works.</li>

<li>In some cases, only a part of the item described is by Locke.  
That part is indicated by a note beginning &#0147;See &#0133;&#0148;</li>

<li>Variant issues or states, bibliographical peculiarities, and (in some cases) other editions 
are identified in notes.</li>

<li>Notes may indicate the relationship of the work described to other works cited.</li>

<li>Citations are given to secondary works which discuss bibliographic points 
such as dating and publishing history, or provide corrections to the text of the edition described.</li>

<li>Reviews of significant works are noted.  The listing of contemporary reviews of works published 
before 1714 is fairly complete; these reviews played a significant role in the spread of Locke&#0146;s ideas 
outside England.  The lists of reviews of later works, on the other hand, is suggestive 
rather than comprehensive.</li>

<li>Items which have not been directly verified are marked by an asterisk preceding the item number.  
The source of the information is given in a note, unless it is the same as the bibliographic citations 
(see #8).</li>

<li>Citations are provided to descriptions in other Locke bibliographies or in standard listings 
such as Wing&#0146;s <i>Short-title catalogue.</i>  See the list of <a href="#abbrev">abbreviations</a>.  
Of particular interest are the citations to Harrison and Laslett&#0146;s catalog of the books 
in Locke&#0146;s library.  It is intriguing to note which editions and translations of his works 
and which controversial works Locke owned.</li>
</ol>

<p class="int"><b>INCORRECT OR DOUBTFUL ATTRIBUTIONS:</b> 
Works which have been falsely attributed to Locke are listed in the appendix.  
Titles are given in chronological order of first publication, with a listing of editions 
and notes on the source and merits of the attribution, and the identity of the true author when known.  
Items in the appendix are assigned a separate sequence of numbers, 
which are preceded by an &#0147;A&#0148;.</p>

<p class="int"><b>INDEXES:</b> There are three indexes.  The <b>Name/Title Index</b> includes the names of editors, translators, 
authors of prefaces, reviews, controversial works, etc.  
Names are entered according to preferred national usage.<a href="#n11"><sup>11</sup></a>  
In a few exceptional cases, titles of anonymous and pseudonymous works are included in the Name/Title Index. 
For the titles of Locke&#0146;s works, see the <a href="#otoc">Table of Contents</a> above.
<!--Cross-references are provided from alternative forms of names.  The citation is to the item number 
unless preceded by &#0147;p.&#0148;  An &#0147;r&#0148; following the item number indicates a review; 
an &#0147;n&#0148; following the item or page number indicates a work cited in the notes.  
An &#0147;A&#0148; preceding the item number indicates an incorrect attribution listed in the appendix.-->
</p>

<!--<div class="int1">The <b>Title Index</b> includes titles of anonymous and pseudonymous works only.  
For the titles of Locke&#0146;s works, see the Table of Contents.</div>-->

<p class="int1">The <b>Subject Index</b> includes some entries for works by Locke, 
usually minor works or selections on very specific topics.</p>

<p class="int1">The <b>Language Index</b> lists the works by Locke which have been translated into foreign languages.  
Under each language, the works are arranged by the date of the first translation.</div>

<p class="int"><b>ADDITIONS AND CORRECTIONS:</b>  Compiling bibliographic information is a cumulative task 
and one that never reaches an end.  No work is ever definitive; no work, in fact, remains current 
even so long as it takes for the text to appear in print.  This project continues, and I will be happy 
to correct any errors and to add any new items which are brought to my attention.</p>

<p class="int1">Work also continues on the remaining part of the project: the literature about Locke.  
It already comprises some 5000 entries, the largest such file I am aware of.  
It is extensively indexed by name, title, date, and subject.  I welcome inquiries on particular topics 
or notices of new material.</p>

build on each other&#0146;s work.  They are odd fish who read an author&#0146;s footnotes 
before they read his text.  My debt to previous bibliographers is hinted at 
in the bibliographic citations which I have provided.  
My debt to the footnotes of countless Locke scholars is too vast even to be hinted at, 
but is sincerely felt nonetheless.</p>

<p class="int1">Bibliographers inhabit libraries.  Again my debt to countless (often nameless) librarians 
is too vast to be adequately acknowledged.  However, no author should fail to pay tribute 
to those gallant folk who are striving to preserve the intellectual heritage of the past 
and to make it available to present and future scholars.</p>

<p class="int1">This project was begun in 1975 at Bowling Green State University 
and has continued since 1978 at the Pennsylvania State University.  
I should like to thank Dr. Richard Lineback of the Philosophy Documentation Center at Bowling Green 
for his encouragement of the project and for access to the incomparable collection of philosophy books 
and journals used to compile <i>The Philosopher&#0146;s index.</i>  A grant from the Pennsylvania State University in 1981 enabled me to visit libraries in England and Italy to verify entries for this project.  
I have also received extensive data-processing support from the Pennsylvania State University Libraries, 
and I would like to thank Dean of Libraries Stuart Forth and Assistant Deans Gordon Rawlins, Nancy Cline, 
and Nancy Eaton for this assistance.  Any errors that remain, including typing and formatting errors 
in the final text, must alas be the responsibility of the author.</p>
